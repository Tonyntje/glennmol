            Hi, I'm James. For over 15 years, I've been transforming homes in the Seattle area, 
            bringing my clients' visions to life with quality craftsmanship and attention to detail.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">
            My journey in construction began in my father's workshop, where I learned the value of 
            quality workmanship and honest service. Today, I bring those same values to every project 
            I undertake, personally overseeing each renovation to ensure it meets my high standards.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-600">
            I believe in building not just beautiful spaces, but lasting relationships with my clients. 
            When you work with me, you're getting a dedicated craftsman who treats your home as if it 
            were my own.

            "I believe that every home has a story to tell, and every renovation is an opportunity 
            to write a new chapter. My approach is simple: listen carefully to my clients' needs, 
            provide honest advice, and deliver exceptional craftsmanship."
